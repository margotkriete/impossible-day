    "title": "MY LIFE - A BUMPY RIDE",
    "author": "Deependra Tiwari",
    "description": "To me, Mrs Ranga said, \"You hare, you don't seem ready to smile! \nIs there any joy in the damn colony, under leaky roof and with you by my side?\" I would reply.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She resumes meekly, \"Obviously no, sorry, I forgot of all this.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since very little in our lives seems to be making sense, we could take a sip down the madness lane. The book is a blast of humour, meld with delicious ironies. The narrator stitches madness into his bumpy stories on the premise, \"You have only a little spark of madness. You must not lose it.\" The fiction work palms off madness as a virtue, as priceless as sensibility. Although present in a tiny core, the sense of madness very often misses a lasting chance. The narrative dives deep enough to prove that if wisdom ever existed in the likeness of a double-edged sword, its two edges would be none other than the madness and sensibility. The narrator fly opens a narrow window to play mockery at the sad state of affairs. The serious aspects of the life of a middle - aged man, go truly underrated. The writer seeks to add a fresh perspective to the typical problematics that are more than one in a day-to-day life. Though written in the format of diary entries, the sensual shock that each following line sends down the spine is inconceivable, until read. The characters inside the book are those people who will stay with you, even long after you keep the book down. As the story progresses, one character turns out to be a greater evil than the other. Even so, in a rare event a reader who duly sympathises with the characters, after fleeting moments, would withdraw his sympathy and curse them instead. The writer upends on the paper, with the alarming yet promising hope that many episodes of bumpy rides are yet to be relished. So, curiouser and curiouser!"
